Uses English phonotactics.

Notes:

/s/ is represented more often as the first consonant (c1) 
	because it can take the first vowel in a complex onset more often than any other letter	

/l/ is represented more often as the second consonant (c2) 
	because it can take this position more often than any other letter in a complex onset	

In all constructions each vowel is represented at least once in each vowel position.

Phonemes are not repeated in any word.
