Images taken from Rossion & Pourtois. 

Centred subsets are images centred in a 281 by 281 pixel white background.

GIF compressed subsets are the same images compressed into GIF files in GIMP.

# Norm ratings

## Rossion & Pourtois

Norm ratings from Rossion and Pourtois are taken from:

Rossion, B., & Pourtois, G. (2004). Revisiting Snodgrass and Vanderwart's object pictorial set: The role of surface detail in basic-level object recognition. Perception, 33(2), 217-236.

This article includes pdf appendices for ratings for every item. We provide these converted to csv files for easy reuse.

## Forsythe et al.

Norm ratings from Forsythe et al. are taken from:

This is a dataset from:

Forsythe, A., Street, N., & Helmy, M. (2017). Revisiting Rossion and Pourtois with new ratings for automated complexity, familiarity, beauty, and encounter. Behavior Research Methods, 1-10.

This paper improves on the norm ratings for the Rossion and Pourtois picture set.

Here, we have individual ratings of:

- familiarity
- how often people encounter each object
- image complexity from participants (rather than all at once)

Forsythe et al. also generated GIF and JPEG compression file sizes as an objective measure of image complexity.

## Williams et al.

These are norms from the current article. Our methods for creating these norms are outlined in the paper.
